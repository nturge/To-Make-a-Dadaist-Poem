# To-Make-a-Dadaist-Poem
This project is a reimagining of Tristan Tzara's 1920 instructional piece, [To Make a Dadaist Poem](https://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/tzara.html). In Tzara's original piece, a method for constructing a poem is proposed in which users cut a newspaper into individual words or phrases and place those clippings in a paper bag. Pulling clippings out randomly and sequencing them generates an original poem with indeterminate results. By adapting this piece for the web, I hoped to take Tzara's initial method and adjust it to the circumstances by which news is gathered, shared, and composed on the modern web. 

In adapting this piece for the web, the site uses [news.io's](https://newsdata.io/) news API, and loads the headings of the most recent news into an array. Items from the array are randomly assigned to the keyboard element, so that each key hides a fragment of the most recent headlines. Typing through these elements generates a poem, a headline --- whatever you see fit to call it, that is composed indeterminantly from its source material in a manner akin to Tzara's paper-bag-randomness. Work is currently being done to develop this site further, in order to create a working server where users can save and post their latest news entries. This site was written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript using [netnet.studio](https://netnet.studio/). You can try it live at [To-Make-A-Dadaist-Poem](https://nturge.github.io/To-Make-a-Dadaist-Poem/)
